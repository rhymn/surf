# unplas.tech

This repository contains the foundational documentation for the unplas.tech project.

## How to Read This Repository

The project documentation is organized in a flat, numbered structure within the `/docs` directory. **Numbers indicate authority: lower numbers have higher authority.**

When documents conflict, defer to the lower-numbered document.

## What This Project Is

unplas.tech focuses on **removing plastic from marine environments and locking it into stable, durable forms**. 

We do **not** claim circularity, closed-loop recycling, or infinite reuse. This is about removal and containment, not purity.

## Where to Start

Begin with **[docs/00_CORE.md](/docs/00_CORE.md)** — the single source of truth for the project.

Then read sequentially through the numbered documents:
- `00_CORE.md` — Mission, thesis, principles, language
- `01_THEORY_OF_CHANGE.md` — Problem, intervention, impact model
- `02_MATERIAL_SYSTEM.md` — Material sourcing and processing
- `03_PRODUCTS.md` — What we build (and won't build)
- `04_BRAND.md` — How we communicate
- `05_BUSINESS_MODEL.md` — Economic sustainability
- `06_RISK_AND_GOVERNANCE.md` — Risks and constraints
- `07_INVESTOR.md` — Investor-facing summary
- `08_PUBLIC.md` — Public communication guidelines

All documents use restrained, honest language. No greenwashing. No overclaiming.
