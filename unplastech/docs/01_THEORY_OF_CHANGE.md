# Theory of Change

How removing ocean plastic and stabilizing it into durable products creates measurable impact.

---

## The Problem

Plastic in marine environments causes disproportionate harm:
- Entanglement and ingestion by marine life
- Breakdown into microplastics that enter food chains
- Persistent contamination of ecosystems for centuries
- Concentration in vulnerable coastal and near-shore environments

Ocean plastic is not evenly distributed. It accumulates in specific zones: beaches, fishing communities, river mouths, and coastal convergence areas. These are where removal has the highest impact per kilogram.

## The Intervention

**Step 1: Removal**  
Collect degraded plastic from marine environments before it fragments further or re-enters the water.

**Step 2: Stabilization**  
Lock plastic into inert, thick forms using mechanical binding and minimal processing. No melting of mixed materials. No fine shredding. The goal is containment, not transformation.

**Step 3: Deployment**  
Place stabilized material into durable products (infrastructure or flagship objects) that remain intact for years or decades.

**Step 4: Funding Loop**  
Use revenue from desirable products to fund ongoing collection and processing. The more compelling the product, the more removal it funds.

## Why Products?

Products serve two functions:

1. **Economic sustainability:** Collection and stabilization require labor, transport, and facilities. Products generate revenue to fund operations at scale.

2. **Visibility and narrative:** Physical objects tell the story of removal and containment. They make the work tangible and fundable.

This is not about selling hope or guilt-free consumption. It is about funding impact through desire.

## What Success Looks Like

- **Kilograms removed** from marine environments (measured by collection volume)
- **Kilograms stabilized** in durable forms (measured by product output)
- **Reduced virgin plastic demand** through substitution (where products replace virgin alternatives)
- **Visibility and replication** (other entities adopt similar models)

Success is not perfection. It is measurable reduction in harm.

## What Failure Looks Like

- **Re-entry into ecosystems:** Stabilized material breaks down and returns to the environment
- **Overclaiming impact:** Exaggerating removal volume or environmental benefit
- **Greenwashing:** Using ocean plastic as a marketing story without genuine containment
- **Economic collapse:** Inability to sustain collection and processing operations

Failure is not imperfection. It is making the problem worse while claiming to solve it.
