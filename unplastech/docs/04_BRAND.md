# Brand

How we communicate, what we show, and what we do not.

## Brand Manifesto

unplas.tech is about **material damage and consequence**, not purity or symbolism.

Plastic in the ocean is not a metaphor. It is a physical problem requiring physical removal and physical containment. Our brand reflects that reality:
- **Concrete over abstract:** We talk about kilograms, forms, and processes, not feelings.
- **Consequence over virtue:** We acknowledge trade-offs instead of claiming perfection.
- **Weight over lightness:** Stabilized material has mass. We do not hide that.

The brand does not exist to make people feel better about plastic. It exists to fund its removal from marine environments.

## Tone and Voice

**Calm, direct, unsensational, confident.**

### What This Sounds Like:
- "Plastic removed from beaches and locked into pavers."
- "This bench contains 40 kg of ocean plastic. It will not break down for decades."
- "We do not claim circularity. We claim containment."

### What This Does Not Sound Like:
- "Join the revolution! Together we can save the ocean!"
- "Feel good about your impact with guilt-free products."
- "Closing the loop on plastic waste."

We do not exaggerate. We do not moralize. We do not sell hope as a product.

## Storytelling Framework

Every object has three parts:

### 1. Origin
Where the material came from. Be specific:
- "Collected from fishing nets on the coast of Cornwall"
- "Sourced from beach cleanup operations in Devon"
- "Intercepted at river mouths before entering the Atlantic"

### 2. Transformation
How the material was processed. Be honest:
- "Mechanically reduced to 1–5 cm fragments"
- "Compressed with mineral binder into 10 cm thick blocks"
- "No melting. No extrusion. Aggregate containment."

### 3. Outcome
What the object does now. Be concrete:
- "Deployed as public seating. Expected lifespan: 20+ years."
- "Used as paving material. Locks plastic in place."
- "Funds collection of 200 kg additional material annually."

Do not add flourish. The facts are sufficient.

## Visual Philosophy

**Visible imperfection. Texture. Weight.**

### What We Show:
- Raw, unpolished surfaces
- Visible fragments and material origin
- Thickness and mass
- Outdoor deployment in real environments
- Weathering and degradation over time (honestly)

### What We Do Not Show:
- Green utopias or pristine beaches
- Smiling people holding small objects
- Lifestyle fantasy or aspiration
- Before/after transformations that exaggerate change
- Perfection or flawless finishes

The material is what it is. We show it as it is.

## Language Discipline

Refer to **CORE** for approved and avoided language. Key constraints:

**Use:**  
Removal, containment, stabilization, degraded material, downcycling, consequence, responsibility.

**Avoid:**  
Circular, closed-loop, plastic-neutral, infinite reuse, guilt-free, solved.

This discipline is non-negotiable. Slipping into greenwashing language—even accidentally—undermines the entire project.

## What We Do Not Sell

- **Guilt relief:** We do not make people feel better about consumption.
- **Perfection:** We do not claim our solution is complete or flawless.
- **Virtue:** We do not position buyers as heroes for purchasing products.
- **Certainty:** We do not pretend the future is predictable or controllable.

We sell **objects that fund impact**. That is the transaction.

**Authority:** Derived from CORE. Governs all communication and visual output.
