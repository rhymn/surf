## Public Statement

**Plastic does not belong in the ocean.**

Once removed, it should not return.

unplas.tech removes plastic from marine environments and locks it into stable, durable forms. We do not claim circularity. We do not promise perfection. We remove plastic and keep it out.

This is not about solving the entire crisis. It is about measurable reduction in harm.

## Object Information & QR Reference

Any object (installation, flagship, or infrastructure) may include a **QR code** linking to a public material record.

### Standard Object Text

This text (or similar) accompanies physical objects:

> **Material Origin:**  
> This object contains plastic removed from [specific location, e.g., beaches in Cornwall, fishing nets from Devon coast].
>
> **Processing:**  
> Mechanically reduced to 1–5 cm fragments. Stabilized using [compression/mineral binding]. No melting. No extrusion.
>
> **Containment:**  
> Locked into thick, durable form. Expected lifespan: [20+ years]. Will not be recycled into consumer goods.
>
> **Impact:**  
> This object contains approximately [X kg] of ocean plastic. Its production funded the collection of [Y kg] additional material.
>
> **Not Circular:**  
> This is downcycling, not recycling. The plastic is contained, not endlessly reused.
>
> **Scan QR code for full material record.**

### Public Material Record (QR Link Destination)

The QR code links to a simple web page containing:
- **Collection date and location** (as specific as possible)
- **Processing method** (cleaning, size reduction, binding technique)
- **Material composition** (mixed ocean plastic, polymer types if known)
- **Contamination notes** (any known contaminants or hazards)
- **End-of-life guidance** (reuse as aggregate or controlled disposal)
- **Limitations and trade-offs** (e.g., "not suitable for food contact," "may degrade over decades")

The record is **factual, not promotional.** It documents the object's material history without exaggeration.

## Website Copy Principles

Public-facing web content follows these guidelines:

### 1. Short and Factual
Avoid long paragraphs or narrative flourish. State what is true.

**Example:**  
"We remove plastic from beaches and fishing communities. We lock it into pavers, benches, and blocks. We do not claim this solves the plastic crisis. We claim it removes plastic from the ocean and keeps it out."

### 2. Uncomfortable Where Needed
Do not soften trade-offs or hide limitations.

**Example:**  
"This plastic will not be recycled again. It is locked into thick forms designed to degrade slowly. When it eventually breaks down, it will be managed as waste, not returned to the ecosystem."

### 3. No Aspiration or Lifestyle
Do not position products as part of a desirable identity or lifestyle.

**Bad:** "Join the ocean-conscious movement with our eco-friendly furniture."  
**Good:** "This bench contains 40 kg of ocean plastic. It funds the collection of 200 kg more."

### 4. Transparent Metrics
Share concrete numbers where available. Do not abstract impact into vague claims.

**Example:**  
"As of [date], we have removed [X kg] from [Y locations] and stabilized it into [Z products]."

### 5. Language Discipline
Follow **CORE** language guidelines strictly:

**Use:** Removal, containment, stabilization, degraded material, downcycling, consequence, responsibility.

**Avoid:** Circular, closed-loop, plastic-neutral, infinite reuse, guilt-free, solved.

## Messaging Framework

### What We Say:
- "Plastic does not belong in the ocean. Once removed, it should not return."
- "We remove and contain ocean plastic in durable forms."
- "This is downcycling, not recycling. We are honest about that."
- "Products fund impact. Flagship objects generate revenue to fund collection at scale."
- "We measure success in kilograms removed and stabilized."

### What We Do Not Say:
- "We're closing the loop on ocean plastic."
- "Guilt-free consumption starts here."
- "Together, we can solve the plastic crisis."
- "Infinitely recyclable ocean plastic products."
- "Feel good about your impact."

---

## Tone Consistency

Across all public channels (website, social media, product labels, press releases):
- **Calm, not urgent**
- **Direct, not emotional**
- **Confident, not defensive**
- **Honest, not optimistic**

We do not sell hope. We sell objects that fund removal and containment.

## Press and Media Guidelines

When speaking to press or media:
1. **Quantify impact:** State kilograms removed and stabilized, not abstract claims.
2. **Acknowledge trade-offs:** Do not pretend the solution is perfect.
3. **Avoid buzzwords:** Do not let journalists add "circular" or "sustainable" if inaccurate.
4. **Correct misrepresentation:** If media coverage exaggerates claims, issue a public correction.

The brand exists to fund impact. Protecting the brand means protecting the honesty that differentiates it.

**Authority:** Derived from CORE and BRAND. Governs all public communication.
