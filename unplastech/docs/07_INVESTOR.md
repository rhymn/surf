## One-Page Summary

**unplas.tech** removes plastic from marine environments and locks it into stable, durable products.

### Mission
Take plastic out of the ocean and keep it out. Removal and containment, not purity or circularity.

### Theory of Change
1. Collect degraded plastic from beaches, fishing communities, and coastal zones
2. Stabilize material using mechanical binding (no melting, thick forms only)
3. Deploy into durable products: flagship objects (revenue) and infrastructure products (scale)
4. Use revenue from flagship objects to fund ongoing collection and processing

### Why This Model Works

**Economic sustainability:**  
Revenue from desirable products funds unglamorous impact work at scale.

**Honest positioning:**  
No greenwashing. No circular claims. Transparent about trade-offs and limitations.

**Early funding signal:**  
£10,000 seed funding secured for pilot-scale validation. Demonstrates feasibility and investor confidence.

**Measurable impact:**  
Kilograms collected, kilograms stabilized, virgin plastic substituted. Concrete metrics, not abstract claims.

## Market Opportunity

### Primary Revenue: Flagship Objects
- Limited-production statement pieces (furniture, installations, art objects)
- Premium pricing (£500–£5,000+)
- Buyers include individuals, institutions, and organizations seeking tangible impact
- High margins fund infrastructure production

### Secondary Revenue: Infrastructure Products
- High-volume, utilitarian products (pavers, benches, blocks, barriers)
- Competitive pricing with virgin alternatives
- Markets: public infrastructure, construction, coastal protection
- Absorbs the majority of collected material

**The dynamic:** Sexy products fund boring impact. Flagship objects generate revenue. Infrastructure products deploy material at scale.

---

## Capital Use

### Pilot Phase (Current: £10,000 seed)
- Establish first coastal collection partnership (Cornwall)
- Build proof-of-concept processing system
- Produce initial infrastructure product batch (pavers/blocks)
- Generate flagship object prototypes for revenue validation

### Scale Phase (Future funding)
- Expand collection capacity to multiple coastal regions
- Build modular processing facilities
- Increase infrastructure product production
- Develop flagship object pipeline for consistent revenue

---

## Key Metrics

Success is measured by:
- **Kilograms removed** from marine environments
- **Kilograms stabilized** in durable products
- **Revenue per kilogram processed** (flagship objects)
- **Volume deployed** (infrastructure products)
- **Cost per kilogram** (collection and processing efficiency)

All metrics are material and verifiable, not abstract.

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Feedstock variability:** Design around inconsistency (aggregate use, thick forms).  
**Contamination:** No heating, no sensitive applications, batch testing.  
**Scalability:** Modular capacity tied to proven feedstock availability.  
**Greenwashing perception:** Language discipline and transparent reporting.

## Competitive Position

Most "ocean plastic" products are:
1. **Greenwashing:** Virgin plastic with trace ocean plastic content
2. **Consumer goods:** Small items with high re-entry risk
3. **Circular claims:** Dishonest about actual material loops

unplas.tech differentiates through:
- **Containment over circularity:** Honest about downcycling
- **Thick, durable forms:** Designed for decades, not months
- **Transparent trade-offs:** No perfection claims
- **Infrastructure focus:** Mass deployment, not consumer trinkets

---

## Current Status

**Pilot-scale validation in progress.**

Seed funding secured. First collection partnerships forming. Processing system in development.

Next milestone: Demonstrate **unit economics** (cost per kg processed, revenue per kg stabilized) at pilot scale.

---

## Investment Opportunity

**Seeking:** Additional capital to scale from pilot to operational capacity.

**Use of funds:** Collection expansion, processing infrastructure, flagship object production, impact reporting systems.

**Return model:** For-impact, not venture-scale returns. Revenue used to fund operations and growth, not maximize shareholder profit.

**Exit strategy:** Sustainable operations that do not require ongoing external funding. Potential for B-Corp structure or impact-aligned acquisition.
