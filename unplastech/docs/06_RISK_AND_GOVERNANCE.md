# Risk and Governance

Key risks, mitigation strategies, and ethical constraints.

---

## Key Risks

### 1. Feedstock Variability
**Risk:** Ocean plastic composition is unpredictable. Polymer types, contamination levels, and degradation states vary by location and time.

**Impact:** Inconsistent material properties, difficulty establishing reliable processes, potential safety issues.

**Mitigation:**
- Design around variability (thick forms, aggregate use, no melting)
- Minimal sorting by form and risk, not polymer type
- Test for high-risk contaminants (heavy metals, persistent chemicals) on batches
- Accept that consistency is limited and communicate that honestly

---

### 2. Toxicity and Contamination
**Risk:** Ocean plastic may contain absorbed pollutants (PCBs, heavy metals, pesticides) or inherent additives (flame retardants, plasticizers).

**Impact:** Health risks to processors and end users; regulatory non-compliance; reputational damage.

**Mitigation:**
- **Thick forms only:** No thin-walled or high-surface-area products that increase exposure
- **No heating:** Avoid melting mixed materials to prevent toxic off-gassing
- **Avoid sensitive applications:** No food contact, wearables, or indoor air exposure
- **Batch testing:** Sample-based testing for contaminants on collected material
- **Honest communication:** Disclose material origin and limitations to users

---

### 3. Regulatory Compliance
**Risk:** Plastic products (especially recycled) face varying regulations by jurisdiction (EU, UK, US). Ocean plastic is particularly complex.

**Impact:** Products may be restricted or require costly testing and certification.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on **non-regulated applications first** (outdoor infrastructure, public installations)
- Engage with regulators early to understand constraints
- Document material sources and processing transparently
- Avoid categories with strict regulatory requirements (e.g., children's products, food contact)

---

### 4. Greenwashing Perception
**Risk:** Even with honest communication, the project may be perceived as greenwashing or "ocean plastic theater."

**Impact:** Loss of credibility, backlash from environmental advocates, media criticism.

**Mitigation:**
- **Language discipline:** Follow CORE guidelines strictly (no "circular," no "solved")
- **Measurable claims only:** Report kilograms collected and stabilized, not abstract impact
- **Transparency on trade-offs:** Acknowledge what we do not solve (e.g., microplastic creation during processing)
- **Third-party verification:** Where possible, document and verify collection and processing data

---

### 5. Scalability Limits
**Risk:** Demand for products may outpace available ocean plastic feedstock, or feedstock may exceed processing capacity.

**Impact:** Either unfulfilled demand or accumulating unprocessed material.

**Mitigation:**
- **Clear capacity limits:** Do not overpromise collection or production volume
- **Modular scaling:** Build processing capacity in stages tied to proven feedstock availability
- **Reject virgin plastic blending:** Do not dilute ocean plastic with virgin material to meet demand

---

### 6. End-of-Life Leakage
**Risk:** Stabilized products degrade over time and fragments re-enter ecosystems.

**Impact:** Failure of core mission (containment).

**Mitigation:**
- **Thick, dense forms:** Design for slow degradation and minimal fragmentation
- **Deployment in controlled environments:** Public infrastructure, not dispersed consumer products
- **End-of-life tracking:** Where feasible, monitor product condition over years
- **Honest failure acknowledgment:** If products fail to contain material, report and adapt

---

## Ethical Constraints

### 1. No Misleading Claims
We will **never**:
- Claim circularity when we mean downcycling
- Exaggerate kilograms collected or impact achieved
- Imply ocean plastic products "solve" the pollution crisis
- Hide trade-offs or pretend solutions are perfect

### 2. No Unsafe Product Categories
We will **never**:
- Make food-contact items
- Make wearables or products with prolonged skin contact
- Melt mixed ocean plastic without contamination control
- Target children's products without rigorous safety testing

### 3. No Virtue Extraction
We do not sell **guilt relief** or **environmental absolution**.

Products fund impact. They are not indulgences.

## Governance Structure

Currently: **Founder-led with seed funding accountability.**

As the project scales:
- Establish transparent reporting on kilograms collected, processed, and stabilized
- Publish annual impact reports (not marketing documents)
- Engage third-party verification for material sourcing and processing claims
- Consider B-Corp certification or equivalent impact governance framework

Governance exists to ensure **accountability to impact, not optics**.

---

**Authority:** Derived from CORE. Defines operational constraints and risk management.
