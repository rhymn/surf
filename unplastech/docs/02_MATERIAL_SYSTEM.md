# Material System

Technical description of how ocean plastic is collected, processed, and stabilized into durable forms.

---

## Material Sources

Plastic is sourced from:
- **Beaches:** Washed-up debris, including nets, floats, containers, and fragments
- **Fishing communities:** Discarded gear, buoys, rope, and damaged equipment
- **River mouths:** Plastic intercepted before reaching the open ocean
- **Coastal convergence zones:** Areas where currents concentrate floating debris

Feedstock is opportunistic and variable. We do not control what the ocean delivers.

## Sorting

Minimal sorting by **form and risk**, not polymer type.

Categories:
- **High-risk:** Items that may contain heavy metals, persistent chemicals, or unknown contaminants → excluded or isolated
- **Rigid forms:** Hard plastics (containers, crates, floats) → mechanically reduced
- **Flexible forms:** Rope, netting, film → bundled or used as tensile reinforcement
- **Fragments:** Pre-degraded pieces → aggregated

We do **not** attempt polymer separation. Mixed feedstock is the reality of ocean plastic. The system is designed around that constraint.

## Cleaning

Low-impact process to remove salt, sand, and biological matter:
1. **Dry tumble:** Mechanical agitation to remove loose debris
2. **Cold rinse:** Water rinse without detergents or heating
3. **Sun dry:** Passive solar drying to avoid energy use

No chemical treatments. No high-temperature washing. The goal is contamination reduction, not sterility.

---

## Size Reduction

Mechanical reduction to **macro size range (1–5 cm).**

- **No fine shredding:** Avoids creating microplastic dust and respirable particles
- **No grinding to powder:** Thick aggregate forms only
- **Hand tools and low-speed equipment:** Reduces heat generation and particle dispersion

Plastic is treated as **aggregate material**, not raw feedstock for extrusion.

---

## Mechanical Binding

Plastic fragments are locked into stable forms using:
- **Compression:** Hydraulic or mechanical pressing to densify material
- **Mineral binders:** Cement, lime, or clay-based matrices (plastic as aggregate)
- **Bio-binders:** Plant-based resins or starches where appropriate
- **Mechanical interlocking:** Weaving, bundling, or netting for tensile strength

**Explicitly no melting or extrusion** of mixed ocean plastic. Heating mixed materials risks:
- Toxic off-gassing from unknown contaminants
- Chemical reactions between incompatible polymers
- Energy-intensive processes that undermine impact claims

The binding process creates **inert, monolithic forms** that resist fragmentation.

---

## End Product Forms

Stabilized material is deployed as:
- **Thick blocks** (10+ cm thickness)
- **Pavers and tiles** (3–5 cm thickness)
- **Structural elements** (beams, posts, benches)
- **Encased aggregates** (plastic bound within mineral matrix)

All forms are designed for **durability and containment**, not aesthetics or precision.

---

## End-of-Life Strategy

When products reach end-of-life:
1. **Reuse as aggregate:** Crush and reintegrate into new forms
2. **Controlled disposal:** Landfill as inert material (not ideal, but contained)

We do **not** claim these products will be recycled into new consumer goods. That would be dishonest.
