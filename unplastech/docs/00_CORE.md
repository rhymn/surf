# CORE

**Status:** Single source of truth. Changes rarely.

This document defines the foundation of unplas.tech. When other documents conflict with CORE, CORE wins.

## Mission

Remove plastic from marine environments and lock it into stable, durable forms that cannot re-enter ecosystems.

---

## Core Thesis

**Plastic does not belong in the ocean.**

Once removed, it should not return. That means:
- **Removal + containment > purity:** We prioritize taking plastic out and keeping it out, not achieving material perfection.
- **Products fund scale:** Desirable objects generate revenue that funds collection and processing at scale.
- **Desire finances responsibility:** The market for compelling products underwrites the unglamorous work of removal and stabilization.

---

## Non-Goals

We explicitly do **not** pursue:
- Circular economy claims
- Consumer recycling narratives
- Solving the entire plastic crisis
- Material perfection or purity
- Hiding trade-offs or pretending problems don't exist

---

## Principles

1. **Removal over ideology:** Take plastic out of the ocean first. Debate later.
2. **Containment over reuse:** Lock it into stable forms, not infinite loops.
3. **Honesty over optics:** Say what is true, not what sounds good.
4. **Design around degradation:** Assume materials will degrade. Design for that reality.
5. **Desire funds scale:** Beautiful, functional objects generate revenue for impact.

## Language We Use

- Removal
- Containment
- Sequestration
- Degraded material
- Downcycling
- Consequence
- Responsibility
- Stabilization

---

## Language We Avoid

- Circular
- Closed-loop
- Plastic-neutral
- Infinite reuse
- Guilt-free consumption
- Solved
- Zero-waste (when inaccurate)

---

## Red Lines

We will **never**:
- Make products with food contact
- Make wearables or items in prolonged skin contact
- Melt mixed ocean plastic without rigorous contamination control
- Make exaggerated impact claims
- Hide trade-offs or pretend solutions are perfect
- Claim circularity when we mean downcycling

**Authority:** Highest. All other documents derive from CORE.
