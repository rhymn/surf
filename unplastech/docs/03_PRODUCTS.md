# Products

What we build, what we will not build, and why.

## Two Product Layers

unplas.tech operates with a dual-layer product strategy:

### 1. Flagship Objects (Brand Layer)

**Purpose:** Generate visibility, narrative, and revenue to fund impact work.

**Characteristics:**
- Limited production
- High visibility and storytelling potential
- Premium pricing (scarcity model)
- Designed for desire and conversation
- Each object funds kilograms of collection and processing

**Examples:**
- Statement furniture pieces
- Architectural installations
- Public art objects
- Limited-edition functional objects

These are not virtue signals. They are revenue generators that make the unglamorous work economically viable.

### 2. Infrastructure Products (Impact Layer)

**Purpose:** Deploy stabilized material at scale in durable, utilitarian forms.

**Characteristics:**
- Mass production where possible
- Designed for longevity and weight
- Deployed in public and industrial settings
- Priced for volume and accessibility
- Prioritize containment over aesthetics

**Examples:**
- **Pavers and blocks:** Pathways, foundations, landscaping
- **Benches and seating:** Parks, waterfronts, public spaces
- **Barriers and bollards:** Coastal protection, traffic control
- **Aggregate for construction:** Plastic-bound concrete or composite materials

Infrastructure products absorb the majority of collected material. They are the impact work that flagship objects fund.

## Design Principles

Across both layers:
- **Visible imperfection:** Material origins are evident, not hidden
- **Weight and thickness:** Mass equals containment
- **Durability over beauty:** Longevity is the primary metric
- **Degradation planning:** Assume material will degrade; design for safe failure modes

## What We Will Not Build

We explicitly exclude certain product categories for safety, feasibility, or ethical reasons:

### Wearables
No clothing, accessories, or items in prolonged skin contact. Ocean plastic may contain contaminants unsuitable for wearables.

### Consumer Goods
No small disposable items (e.g., cups, utensils, packaging). These defeat the purpose of containment and risk re-entry into waste streams.

### Food-Adjacent Items
No cutting boards, bowls, containers, or any object that contacts food. Contamination risk is unacceptable.

### Precision Parts
No components requiring tight tolerances or reliable mechanical performance (e.g., gears, fittings). Material variability makes this infeasible.

### Single-Use or Short-Life Items
No products designed to be discarded within months or years. Containment requires durability.

## Product Philosophy

Products are **tools for funding and containment**, not symbols of consumer virtue.

We do not make objects to help people feel good about consumption. We make objects that fund the removal of plastic from the ocean and keep it locked in stable forms.

If an object does not serve that goal—economically or physically—we do not make it.
