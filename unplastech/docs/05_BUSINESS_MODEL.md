# Business Model

How unplas.tech sustains collection and processing operations economically.

## Two-Layer Model

The business operates on a **dual-layer revenue and impact structure:**

### Layer 1: Flagship Objects (Revenue)
- High-visibility, limited-production objects
- Premium pricing based on scarcity, narrative, and design
- Sold to individuals, institutions, and organizations seeking tangible impact
- Generates disproportionate revenue relative to material volume

### Layer 2: Infrastructure Products (Scale)
- High-volume, utilitarian products (pavers, benches, blocks)
- Priced for accessibility and adoption
- Deployed in public spaces, construction projects, and industrial settings
- Absorbs the majority of collected material

**The model:** Sexy products fund boring impact.

Flagship objects generate revenue that subsidizes the collection, processing, and deployment of infrastructure products. Infrastructure products are where the kilograms go.

## Pricing Logic

Pricing reflects two distinct strategies:

### Flagship Objects: Scarcity Model
- Priced at £500–£5,000+ per object, depending on scale and complexity
- Limited production runs (10–100 units per design)
- Positioned as investment pieces with provenance and narrative
- Buyers are funding removal, not just acquiring an object

### Infrastructure Products: Durability Model
- Priced competitively with virgin material alternatives (e.g., concrete pavers, plastic lumber)
- Volume discounts for public projects and bulk orders
- Goal is substitution of virgin material, not premium positioning

Neither model is charity. Both require economic viability.

## Use of Funds

Revenue is allocated across three operational areas:

### 1. Collection (30–40%)
- Labor for beach and coastal cleanup
- Transport and logistics from collection sites
- Partnerships with fishing communities and cleanup organizations

### 2. Processing (30–40%)
- Cleaning, sorting, and size reduction
- Mechanical binding and stabilization
- Equipment maintenance and facility costs

### 3. Deployment and Scale (20–30%)
- Production of flagship and infrastructure products
- Installation and distribution
- Expansion of collection and processing capacity

Remaining funds (if any) are reinvested in operations, not extracted as profit until the system achieves self-sustaining scale.

## Current Status

**£10,000 seed funding secured** for pilot-scale validation.

This initial capital is allocated to:
- Establish first collection partnership (Cornwall coast)
- Build proof-of-concept processing system (compression + mineral binding)
- Produce first batch of infrastructure products (pavers and blocks)
- Generate initial flagship object prototypes for revenue testing

The pilot's goal is to validate the **unit economics** of collection, processing, and product deployment. Success is measured by cost per kilogram processed and revenue per kilogram stabilized.

---

## Path to Scale

Scaling requires proving:
1. **Collection is reliable:** Consistent feedstock supply from coastal partnerships
2. **Processing is economical:** Cost per kilogram is sustainable at volume
3. **Products sell:** Both flagship objects and infrastructure products find buyers
4. **Impact is measurable:** Kilograms removed and stabilized can be tracked and verified

If these conditions are met, the model funds itself through revenue. If not, external funding (grants, investment, partnerships) will be required to bridge gaps.

---

## What We Are Not

- Not a charity (though impact-aligned)
- Not a certified B-Corp or social enterprise (yet)
- Not venture-backed (currently)
- Not seeking to maximize shareholder returns over impact

This is a **for-impact business** that uses market mechanisms to fund removal and containment. Profit is a tool, not the goal.
